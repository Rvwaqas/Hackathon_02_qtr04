## Prompt

```
SPECIFY.md - Phase I: Todo Console App (Basic Level)
Project Overview
Target: Python command-line todo application with in-memory storage
Audience: Hackathon judges evaluating spec-driven development proficiency
Focus: Core CRUD operations demonstrating Claude Code + Spec-Kit workflow
Success Criteria

User can add, view, update, delete, and mark tasks complete via CLI
All code generated by Claude Code (zero manual coding)
Clean project structure with /src, /specs, README.md, CLAUDE.md
Demonstrable spec → plan → tasks → implement workflow
Working demo under 90 seconds

Features (Basic Level Only)
F1: Add Task
User Story: As a user, I can create a new task with title and description
Acceptance Criteria:
- Title is required (1-200 characters)
- Description is optional (max 1000 characters)
- Task auto-assigned unique ID
- Confirmation message shows task ID

F2: View Task List
User Story: As a user, I can see all my tasks
Acceptance Criteria:
- Display: ID, title, status (pending/completed), description preview (50 chars)
- Empty list shows friendly message
- Tasks ordered by creation time (newest first)

F3: Update Task
User Story: As a user, I can modify task title or description
Acceptance Criteria:
- User provides task ID + new title/description
- Validates task exists before update
- Shows before/after confirmation

F4: Delete Task
User Story: As a user, I can remove a task
Acceptance Criteria:
- User provides task ID
- Confirms deletion before removing
- Shows error if task doesn't exist

F5: Mark Complete/Incomplete
User Story: As a user, I can toggle task completion status
Acceptance Criteria:
- User provides task ID
- Status toggles between pending ↔ completed
- Visual indicator shows new status

Technical Constraints:
- Language: Python 3.13+
- Package Manager: UV
- Storage: In-memory only (list/dict, no database)
- Dependencies: Zero external libraries (stdlib only)
- Platform: Must run on WSL 2 (Windows) and Linux/macOS

Not Building (Phase I Scope):
- Persistent storage (comes in Phase II)
- User authentication (comes in Phase II)
- Task priorities/tags (Intermediate level)
- Due dates/reminders (Advanced level)
- Search/filter (Intermediate level)
- Web interface (comes in Phase II)
```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for Phase 1 Console Todo App following spec-template structure.

Key deliverables:
1. **Specification** (phase1/specs/001-console-todo-app/spec.md):
   - 4 prioritized user stories (P1: Create/View, P2: Mark Complete, P3: Update, P4: Delete)
   - 15 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-015)
   - 10 measurable success criteria (SC-001 through SC-010)
   - Edge cases covering validation, errors, performance
   - 10 documented assumptions
   - Clear out-of-scope items

2. **Quality Checklist** (phase1/specs/001-console-todo-app/checklists/requirements.md):
   - All checklist items passed ✅
   - 0 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (used informed defaults)
   - Ready for planning phase

Specification focuses on user value and behaviors, avoiding implementation details. Success criteria are technology-agnostic and measurable (e.g., "complete workflow in 90 seconds" not "API response <200ms").

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete specification ready for planning; establishes foundation for Phase 1 development
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (specification document, testing defined in acceptance scenarios)
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md (171 lines), requirements.md checklist (54 lines)
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.plan` to generate implementation plan
- 🧠 Reflection: User provided detailed feature description which translated cleanly into prioritized user stories. No clarifications needed - all requirements testable and unambiguous.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Initial PowerShell script error (positional parameter issue) required manual directory creation
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Spec quality checklist - PASS (all 12 items checked)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A (first specification for this feature)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed with `/sp.plan` to validate spec completeness through planning phase
